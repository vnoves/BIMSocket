## How it works ##

<img src='https://github.com/vnoves/BIMSocket/blob/master/Socket/Resources/Connections-01.png' width='150' alt='Conections logo' />

BIMSOCKet is a bidirectional cloud socket to connect any type of 3D software in the industry in real time. For the hackathon we will connect Revit, a Three JS viewer and Unity (maybe be Rhino as well) to our socket and show how it works.

## Features and design principles ##


- **Network-agnostic**.

- **Database-Storage**. 

- **Automatic synchronization**. 

- **Automatic synchronization**.  We're not yet making an effort to support old platforms, but we have tested BIMsocket in Node.js, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, MS Edge, and Electron
