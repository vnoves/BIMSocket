*BIMSOCKet Main Goal*
=====================================================

[BIMSOCKet](https://bimsocket.rocks/) main goal is not only to communicate programs but to enhance the way we work in our industry. Our ultimate goal is create processes and workflows between all the different programs and make them work as whole.

## What is BIMSOCKet for? ##

<img src='https://github.com/vnoves/BIMSocket/blob/master/Socket/Resources/Connections-01.png' width='350' alt='Conections logo' />

[BIMSOCKet](https://bimsocket.rocks/) is a bidirectional cloud socket to connect any type of 3D software in the industry in real time. For the hackathon we will connect Revit, a Three JS viewer and Unity (maybe be Rhino as well) to our socket and show how it works.

## How does it work under the hood? ##

[BIMSOCKet](https://bimsocket.rocks/) allows you to create a [Firebase realtime database](https://firebase.google.com/) and then use addins on each software to connect to it in real time and save changes.

## Features and design principles ##

- **Automatic synchronization**.  We're not yet making an effort to support old platforms, but we have tested BIMsocket in Node.js, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, MS Edge, and Electron

- **Database Storage**. When you use BIMSOCKet everything is saved in a database, you any change you make while you are offline will be updated as soon as you connect again.

- **Format Agnostic**. BIMSOCKet currently use Json as the exchange format but any other format like IFC, glTF, etc. can be use as well.

- **Multi Model Capability**.You can create multiple Sockets and then upload all of them together so every modification will only affect the model origin.

- **Useful API**. ith the BIMSOCKet API you can not only share information but also process it or modified before it reaches any program.

- **Easy plugin**. Create a project in BIMSOCKet is easy, just create a database, install your software node and then select the created database.
